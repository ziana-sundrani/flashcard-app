This project allows users to create their own flashcard decks and auto-generate study decks using ChatGPT. I chose to include log-in capabilities where users are stored in a database. Their passwords are hashed to improve the security of the website. I also chose to store previously created decks in the database so users can go back to their previously created study materials. Finally, users can simply put in a text input, and a new deck will be auto-generated. 

I spent about 10-15 hours creating the app and 5 hours on the SPARK application (login feature).

Description: This project allows users to create their own flashcard decks and auto-generate study decks using ChatGPT. I chose to include log-in capabilities where users are stored in a database. Their passwords are hashed to improve the security of the website. I also chose to store previously created decks in the database so users can go back to their study materials. Finally, users can simply put in a text input, and a new deck will be auto-generated using ChatGPT. The app was deployed using Heroku (backend) and Vercel (frontend).

Tech Stack: I used MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js) as well as the Open AI API. 

I spent about 20-25 hours creating the app and 5 hours on the SPARK application (login feature and deployment).

CLI commands to run in development:
